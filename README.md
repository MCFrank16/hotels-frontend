# Hotels&Co Challenge

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:
to install all dependencies run
```
npm run install
# or
yarn install
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

to start the development server run:
```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

to run the test use:
```
npm run test
# or
yarn test
```

## Strategy

### Step 1: Project initiation
* Collaborate with the business team to understand the requirements, objectives, and vision of the new application.
* Define the scope, goals, and deliverables of the project.
* Set up the project repository on Git and ensure it's accessible to all team members.
### Step 2: Technology stack selection
* Choose the modern stack for the project, as specified in the challenge, we use Next.js, React-query, Tailwind CSS, and React Testing Library.
* Evaluate and select additional libraries or tools that may be needed based on the project requirements.
### Step 3: Design Phase
* Collaborate closely with UI/UX designers to create wireframes, prototypes, and design mockups for the new home page.
* Ensure that the design is user-friendly, visually appealing, and responsive to different screen sizes.
* Develop a design system for reusability and consistency in UI components.
### Step 4: Back-End Integration
* Work with the back-end team to define the API requirements for fetching room data.
* Collaborate on designing the API endpoints for paginated room listings and room details.
* Discuss data formats, authentication, and error handling.
### Step 5: Front-End Development
* Develop the front end using Next.js for server-side rendering, providing fast load times.
* Implement the paginated room listing feature, considering infinite scroll pagination for a seamless user experience.
* Ensure that the application performs well on low-speed internet connections by optimizing image loading and using lazy loading techniques.
* Create a smooth transition for viewing room details by selecting a room from the list.
### Step 6: Code Structure and Reusability
* Organize the codebase into a clear folder structure following best practices.
* Break down the application into reusable UI components, improving maintainability.
* Ensure code simplicity, readability, and consistency throughout the project.
* Implement state management using React-query to efficiently manage API data.
### Step 7: Testing
* Write unit and integration tests for critical components and functionality.
* Utilize React Testing Library for testing the user interface.
* Ensure comprehensive test coverage to catch potential bugs early.
### Step 8: Performance Optimization
* Implement performance optimization techniques, such as code splitting, lazy loading, and caching, to enhance the user experience.
* Optimize images and other assets for faster loading.
* Conduct performance testing to identify and address bottlenecks.
### Step 9: Continuous Integration
* Set up a CI/CD pipeline for automated testing and deployment.
* Ensure the codebase is always in a deployable state.
### Step 10: User Acceptance Testing
* Involve the business team and subject matter experts in user acceptance testing.
* Address any feedback and make necessary adjustments.
### Step 11: Deployment and Go-Live
* Deploy the application to a staging environment for final testing.
* Once the staging environment is approved, deploy the application to production.
* Monitor the application post-launch for any issues and address them promptly.
### Step 12: Documentation
* Create comprehensive documentation, including a README for the source code.
* Document the architecture, codebase, deployment process, and any important configurations.
### Step 13: Handover
* Handover the project to the maintenance and support team for ongoing management and updates.
* Throughout the project, maintain open communication with all stakeholders, conduct regular status meetings, and ensure that the project aligns with the business goals and user needs.
